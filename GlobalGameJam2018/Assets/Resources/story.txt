There’s been an attack, some kind of bio-weapon has hit us 
and is killing everyone who sets foot outside.
You’re not dead yet, so you’re going to retrieve the 
radio beacon parts that were scattered when the 
bio-weapon hit the tower.

I can’t believe you made it! You were the only one from the whole city, I was beginning to worry there was no hope left.
We have to finish the radio tower that the weapon hit so we can contact someone outside of the city to get help.

Oooooo sweetie, thank you soooooooo much for the supplies! Would you like to stay the night here?
I have an extra bed that you can have for the night!

So you’ve discovered my secret.
You know why people are dying and why this tower wasn’t complete, but the world isn’t ready to know what has happened here. 
I’m terribly sorry it had to come to this, but I never expected someone to survive such the side effects for as long as you did. 
Thanks for helping.
