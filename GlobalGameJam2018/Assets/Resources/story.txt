The year is 2033, 
a flu epidemic in 2030 killed 125 million people with the vaccine effectiveness as low as 1%, 
Dr. Mat has vowed to never let that happen again and begins working on a powerful airborne cure for the flu. 
Something went wrong and the cure’s side effects cause death and have the potential to kill all life on Earth. 
After the virus went airborne Dr. Mat destroys the radio tower so no one can be notified about the cause of the outbreak.
